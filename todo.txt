Bar chart for volume of data for each location rather than just number of observers

Diurnal shift:
	- Get diurnal shift to show who is being shown & where they are & setup attr
	- Normalize the diurnal shift then plot EVERYTHING - anything distinct?

-Try to plot all data for each person - one of them has an error I do believe
